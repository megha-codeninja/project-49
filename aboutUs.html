Heya!!
I'm Megha. I really love Origami and this website is created for that purpose only. To teach you'll
the art of Origami.

If you don't know let me tell ya'll that Origami comes from the Japanese. The word means the art of folding paper. "Ori" means "folding," and kami means "paper." In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices. The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques.
